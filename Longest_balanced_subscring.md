Longest Balanced Substring
Write a program that takes in a string made up of parentheses (( and )) . The program should return an integer representing the length of the longest balanced substring with regards to parentheses.
A string is said to be balanced ifit has as many opening parentheses as it has closing parentheses asn if no parenthesis is unmatched. Note that an opening parenthesis can't match a closing parenthesis that comes before it, and similarly, a closing parenthesis can't match an opening parenthesis that comes after it.
Input format:
The input consists of multiple test cases so the first line of the input is the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a string made up of parentheses.
Output format:
The program should return an integer representing the length of the longest balanced substring with regards to parentheses.

Sample input:
1
(()))(

Sample output:
